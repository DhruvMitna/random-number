## Python

1. Install [python](https://python.org/downloads)
2. Download either of the 2 python files (whichever you need).
3. Open the donwloads folder and double-click the file that you downloaded (If you are prompted to select a program to open the file, select python and click ok).

## Javascript

1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/dist/v14.17.4/node-v14.17.4-x64.msi).
2. Download either of the 2 javascript files (whichever you need).
3. Press `win + r`.
4. Type `cmd` and press enter.
5. Type `cd Downloads` and press enter.
